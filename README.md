# mental-health-stress-support-analysis
Analysis of student mental health and stress using Excel. Explores how support systems, academic performance, exercise, sleep, and screen time influence stress levels. Includes dataset, interactive dashboard, and key insights.

# Project Objective

The purpose of this project is to analyze mental health stress levels among students and identify the factors influencing them. The project explores how elements like academic performance, support systems, exercise, sleep, and screen time interact to affect stress levels.
The end goal is to generate actionable insights that can help schools and wellness programs design more effective support strategies.

# Dataset Used

File Name: mental_health_analysis.csv

Data Source: from kaggle

. User_ID

. Survey_Stress_Score

. Support_System

. Exercise_Category

. Academic_Performance

. Sleep_Category

. Screen_Time

. Gender

. Age_Group

. High_Stress (derived column)

# Key Questions (KPIs)

3, What is the relationship between Exercise and Support System?

4, How does Academic Performance influence stress?

5, How does Sleep Quality interfere with stress levels?

6, What are the Age Group Stress Trends?

7,How does Screen Time relate to stress?

8,Are there Gender-based Stress Trends?

9, How does Support System Influence relate to high-stress cases?

10, What are the Resource Gaps across support and performance levels?

 # Process

. Data Loading & Inspection

. Imported dataset into Excel.

. Checked for missing and duplicate values.

. Data Cleaning

Standardized categorical values (e.g., Low, Moderate, High).

Created a new column High_Stress using a conditional formula:

. Data Analysis

Used Pivot Tables to explore relationships between stress and factors like support, exercise, and academics.

Calculated averages and frequencies for each KPI.

Dashboard Creation

Built an interactive Excel dashboard with slicers for:

. Age

. Gender

. Academic Performance

. Exercise Category

 Added data-driven charts for each KPI for easy comparison.

 #  Dashboard Overview

Dashboard Title: Mental Health Stress & Support Dashboard

Visual Components:

. Support System Availability – Bar chart showing count of users by support level.

. Exercise vs Support – Clustered bar chart showing how exercise correlates with support levels.

. Academic Performance vs Stress – Column chart showing average stress scores across performance categories.

. Stress Management Rate – Pie chart showing percentage of high vs low stress.

. Age Group Stress Trends – 3D area chart showing stress by age range.

. Interference with Sleep – Column chart comparing stress based on sleep quality.

. Screen Time vs Stress – Line chart showing effect of screen time on stress.

. Resources Gap – 3D column chart comparing resource access by performance and stress level.

. Support System Influence – Stacked column chart showing stress distribution across support levels.

. Gender-based Stress Trends – Column chart comparing male vs female stress averages.

#  Project Insights 

1. Stress Management Rate:
Only 41% of students managed to maintain low stress levels, while 59% reported high stress. This indicates that stress management remains a challenge for the majority.

2. Support System Availability:
Students with high support systems experienced significantly lower stress scores, showing that emotional and academic support helps prevent high stress.

3. Exercise vs Support:
Regular exercise strongly correlates with better support networks and lower stress. Active students show higher resilience compared to inactive ones.

4. Academic Performance vs Stress:
Students with excellent or good performance tend to have lower stress scores, while those with poor performance exhibit higher stress — likely due to academic pressure or low self-efficacy.

5. Interference with Sleep:
Poor sleep quality directly contributes to higher stress levels. Students with good sleep patterns had lower average stress scores, highlighting the importance of rest.

6. Age Group Stress Trends:
Older students (16–18 years) show slightly higher stress than younger ones (13–15 years), possibly due to increased academic responsibilities.

7. Screen Time vs Stress:
High screen time correlates with increased stress, suggesting that digital overload or lack of offline balance contributes to mental strain.

8. Gender-based Stress Trends:
Female students displayed higher stress averages than males, indicating gender differences in coping mechanisms or stress exposure.

9. Support System Influence:
Students with strong support are less likely to be in the high stress category. The chart confirms support as a major stress buffer.

10. Resource Gaps:
Students with low support and poor performance face the highest stress levels, revealing a resource gap that institutions should target for intervention.

# Final Conclusion

The project reveals that student stress levels are shaped by multiple interdependent factors — academic performance, exercise, sleep, and support systems.
Key takeaways include:

Encourage exercise and physical activity to improve emotional resilience.

Strengthen support systems (peer, family, and institutional).

Reduce screen time and promote better sleep habits.

By combining Excel analytics with clear visual storytelling, this project translates data into actionable insights that can help schools, counselors, and policymakers enhance student mental health and well-being.
